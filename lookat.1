.TH LOOKAT "1" "April 2020" "lookat 2.0.1" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
.PP
lookat \- Un*x file viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lookat
[ \-\-help ] [ \fIfilename\fP ] [ \fIdir_name\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
"lookat" (or "bekijk" in the Dutch version) is a program to view
Un*x text files and manual pages.
.PP
Under DOS I used list.com to view text files. I didn't
find such a program under my favorite OS, GNU/Linux. The standard Un*x
utilities ( more, less, view ...) weren't userfriendly enough. For this
reason I created "lookat".
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--help"
.br
This option displays a help text.
.IP "\fIfile_name\fP"
view \fIfile_name\fP
.IP "\fIdir_name\fP"
change the current directory to \fIdir_name\fP
.SH BUGS
.PP
None known yet, when you find one you let me know :-)
.SH USAGE
.PP
There are four ways to start
.I lookat
:
.PP
* by just typing '\fIlookat\fP', after the program is started you can select
the file you want to view.
.PP
if there is already data on stdin, lookat will read the from stdin,
and display the contents of stdin
.PP
example:
.IP
ls | lookat
.PP
* type '\fIlookat\fP \fIdir_name\fP', change the current directory to
\fIdir_name\fP.
When the program is started you can select the file you want to view.
.PP
* by typing 'lookat <filename>', the file with <filename> will
automatically be loaded.
.PP
* in combination with "man"
.PP
examples :
.IP
man \-Plookat ls
.br
export PAGER=lookat; man ls
.PP
If you like "lookat" as your manual page viewer you can put the
next lines in your /etc/profile
.IP
alias man="man \-Plookat"
.PP
After you have loaded a file, the following keys can be used:

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
.B Note:
.IP
The format of the configuration file has changed, please
remove the "=" sign. The old configuration files will still
work, but may not be supported in the future.
.PP
lookat uses two configuration files a global configuration file
( /etc/lookat.conf ) and a user configuration file ( $HOME/.lookat )
if the user's configuration file exists the global is ignored.
.PP
If the configuration files aren't available the defaults are used.
.SH CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES
.PP
.nf
\fBcursor\fP  \fIon\fP\fb|\fP\fIoff\fP
.fi
.IP
turn the cursor on / off
.PP
.nf
\fBgive_notice\fP  \fIon\fP\fb|\fP\fIof\fP
.fi
.IP
give notice on exit  on / off
.PP
.nf
\fB\.[\fP\fIextension\fP\fB]\fP \fB"\fP\fIexternal cmd\fP\fB"\fP
.fi
.IP
create a new type
.IP
If a filename matches a type the external command will be
used to open the file. A typical usage are gzipped files:
.IP
   \.gz     "gzip \-cd"
.IP
The type order is important lookat will compare the filename
with the types starting with the first type and continues
until a type matches a filename.
.IP
So if you want to define a type for ".gz" and ".tar.gz" files
you have to put the .tar.gz type first.
.PP
.nf
